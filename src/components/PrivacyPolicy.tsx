            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              AlgoUniversity has adopted the following principles to govern its collection, use, retention, transfer,
              disclosure and destruction of personal data:
            </p>

            <div className="space-y-6">

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data
                  subject. This means that AlgoUniversity must tell the data subject what processing will occur
                  (transparency), the processing must match the description given to the data subject (fairness), and
                  it must be for one of the purposes specified in the applicable data protection regulation (lawfulness).
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Personal data shall be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further
                  processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. This means AlgoUniversity must
                  specify exactly what the personal data collected will be used for and limit the processing of that
                  personal data to only what is necessary to meet the specified purpose.

                  Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
                  purposes for which they are processed. This means AlgoUniversity must not store any personal data
                  beyond what is strictly required.

                  Personal data shall be accurate and kept up to date. This means AlgoUniversity must have processes
                  in place for identifying and addressing out-of-date, incorrect and redundant personal data.
                </p>

              <div>

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Personal data shall be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than
                  is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. This means AlgoUniversity
                  must, wherever possible, store personal data in a way that limits or prevents identification of the
                  data subject.

                <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data,
                  including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss,
                  destruction or damage. AlgoUniversity must use appropriate technical and organizational measures to
                  ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data is maintained at all times.

                  The Data Controller (Board of AlgoUniversity) shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate
                  compliance. This means AlgoUniversity must demonstrate that the six data protection principles
                  (outlined above) are met for all personal data for which it is responsible.
